About the Project (ACME Bank)

I built a simple banking application in Python that allows users to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer , receive cashback rewards and logging all transactions in CSV files

Proud Features:

Iâ€™m proud of the Cashback system I implemented, it automatically adds 9.5% cashback on deposits, with a congratulatory message, which makes the app more interactive and fun for the user.
and I applicate what is studied in Cybersecurity about hashing passwords
