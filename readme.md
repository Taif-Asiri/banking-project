#About the Project (ACME Bank)

I built a simple banking application in Python that allows users to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer , receive cashback rewards and logging all transactions in CSV files
-----------------------------------------------------
#Proud Features:
-----------------------------------------------------
I’m proud of the Cashback system I implemented, it automatically adds 9.5% cashback on deposits, with a congratulatory message, which makes the app more interactive and fun for the user.
and I applicate what is studied in Cybersecurity about hashing passwords 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#Libraries used :
--------------------------------------------------------------------
csv – for reading/writing customer and transaction data

os – to check if files exist and handle file paths safely

hashlib – to securely hash passwords

re – to validate passwords with specific rules

datetime – to timestamp transactions

--------------------------------------------------------
#Next Steps:
Add automatic deactivation for overdraft accounts

Improve input validation to prevent errors

Add unit tests for all features to ensure reliability

Possibly create a graphical user interface for easier use
